hi, 

today I'm leaving WhatsApp for good.

The reason behind that is that I simply cannot trust Facebook or any of their companies anymore. 

The recent events ([the Cambridge Analytica scandal](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/technology/whatsapp-facebook-jan-koum.html), [Jan Koum leaving](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html?module=inline), [the private message sharing](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/facebook-privacy.html), etc...) have lead me to finally make the decission I've wanted to make for quite some time now.

You'll find me on [Signal](https://signal.org), [Telegram](https://telegram.org), [Keybase](https://keybase.io/oliviernt), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/oliviernt) or good ol' email: olivier dot tille at gmail dot com 

Take care (of your privacy)

Olivier
